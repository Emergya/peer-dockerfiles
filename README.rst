PEER Dockerfiles
################

Docker environments for PEER.

Dependencies
++++++++++++

Docker
------

`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ is needed to run this sowftware.
On ubuntu, just run::

  $ sudo apt-get install docker.io

Fig
---

`Fig <http://www.fig.sh/>`_ is also needed. Fig is a tool to compose docker
environments consisting of more than one container. Fig has recently been
integrated into Docker's official distribution as
`docker-compose <http://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_, so as soon as
docker-compose reaches linux distributions from upstream, it will be possible
to use it on the unmodified fig config files.

A simple and safe way to get Fig is to install it in a virtualenv::

  $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
  $ virtualenv fig
  $ source fig/bin/activate
  (fig)$ pip install fig

Remember to activate the virtualenv to use fig::

  $ source fig/bin/activate
  (fig)$ fig up
  ...

Usage
+++++

Get the software
----------------

The sources for this project are kept in a public repository in github. You
can either clone the repository with git::

  $ git clone https://github.com/Emergya/peer-dockerfiles.git

Or download a compressed copy::

  $ wget https://github.com/Emergya/peer-dockerfiles/archive/v0.1.zip

Initialization
--------------

Before starting our environments, we need to create a couple of intermediate
docker images. There is a simple script for this::

  $ cd /path/to/peer-dockerfiles
  $ bash initialize.sh

Note: In case the user running these commands is not in the docker group,
it may be necessary to use sudo to execute them.

Starting a development environment
----------------------------------

To start a development environment, enter in a terminal::

  $ cd /path/to/peer-dockerfiles
  $ source /path/to/fig-virtualenv/bin/activate
  $ fig -f fig-dev.yml up

This ends up with a development server listening on the host, on
localhost:8080. Apache logs, peer sources, and pg data files can be
accessed from the host machine at ``dev-env/`` on the peer-dockerfiles
directory.

Starting a Production environment
---------------------------------

To start a production environment, enter in a terminal::

  $ cd /path/to/peer-dockerfiles
  $ source /path/to/fig/bin/activate
  $ fig up

This ends up with an apache server running on localhost:80. Apache logs
and pg data files can be accessed from the host machine at
``prod-env/`` on the peer-dockerfiles directory.

Configuration
+++++++++++++

Image configuration for the development environment
---------------------------------------------------

Before building the docker images for the development environment, it is
possible to edit the configuration for django in
``peer-dev/config/local_settings.py``. If there is need to modify the
configuration after building the images, they have to be deleted with
``docker rmi <images>``, and rebuilt.

Image configuration for the production environment
--------------------------------------------------

Before building the docker images for the production environment, it is
possible to edit the configuration for apache and django. The configuration
for django is in ``peer-dev/config/local_settings.py``. The general
configuration for apache is in ``peer-dev/config/apache2.conf``, and the
configuration for the apache virtual host is in ``peer-dev/config/peer.conf``.
    
If there is need to modify the configuration after building the images, they
have to be deleted with ``docker rmi <images>``, and rebuilt.

Image configuration for PostgreSQL
----------------------------------

It is possible to modify the PostgreSQL config files befor building the
postgresql image, by editing ``postgresql/etc/pg_hba.conf`` and
``postgresql/etc/postgresql.conf``.
If they are modified after building the image, the image has to be dropped and
rebuilt.

Guest data and logs
+++++++++++++++++++

Some of the data generated in the guest environments is exposed in the host.
The development environment creates a directory ``dev-env`` in the host for
this purpose, and likewise the production environment creates a ``prod-env``
directory.

Development environment
-----------------------

The development environment exposes PostgreSQL data at ``dev-env/data/``, where
it is persisted even if the postgresql container is stopped or deleted.
The data managed by git can also be found at ``dev-env/media/``.
PostgreSQL logs are exposed at at ``dev-env/pg_logs/``. The django logs are
also exposed at ``dev-env/dj_logs/``.

Production environment
----------------------

The production environment exposes PostgreSQL data at ``prod-env/data/``, and
PostgreSQL logs at ``prod-env/pg_logs/``. Apache logs can be found at
``prod-env/ap_logs/``.  The data managed by git can also be found at
``prod-env/media/``.


Reusing previous data
---------------------

If there was a previous peer installation and it is necessary to reuse its
data, we have to edit the Fig config files (fig-dev.yml or fig.yml). In the
``volumes`` section of the ``pgdata`` container, we have to change (if we are
using the development environment; if we are using the production environment,
substitute dev-env with prod-env) ``dev-env/data:/data`` to
``dev-env/data:/path/to/old/pg/datadir``. The same applies to git data: We
would have to change the volume in the ``gitdata`` section from
``dev-env/data:/data`` to ``dev-env/media:/path/to/old/peer/media``.
